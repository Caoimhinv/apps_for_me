## Practice Wizard

This is simple app I made to help structure my music practice! I play traditional Irish music on the fiddle. A big part of this is that there's a massive repertoire so at the start of the first covid lockdown I decided to learn a new tune or set of tunes each day to keep myself occupied! Obviously I didn't think it would last as long so when the list of tunes got to over 100, I realised I couldn't recap on each tune every day and as a result I was beginning to forget some of them.  
  
This app goes through the list of tunes 1 by 1, and also picks out 5 random sets to revise, plus the last 3 sets revised. All quite simple but helpful in an extremely niche kind of way! :)
